Dymanic Forecast of five models and thier Essembles

This is a package designed for quickly obtaining forecasts and plots from five models and their Essembles.

The goal of Dyn4cast package is to simplify the the procedure for estimation of models and obtaining time-varying forecast from a time-dependent dataset. The motivation for doing this is borne from the challenges of trying to give up to  date forecast as well as provide trends in the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria. The results of the estimation produces mainly four r objects viz:

-Forecast
-RMSE
-Plot
-Date
