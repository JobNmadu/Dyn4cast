# Dyn4cast 11.11.10-alpha 2022-08-20

A new function `formattedcut` added and is working perfectly. The addition of this function is providing more clarity to the package. Quite a number of editorial fixes were undertaken and the codes are working superbly.

# Dyn4cast 11.11.1.9000 2022-04-25

Mallow's Cp successfully added and documentation improved sufficiently. The codes are working better now and the check results are encouraging.

# Dyn4cast 11.11.01.9000 2022-03-15

Documentation improved and new functions added to the library. Editorial fixes were made.

# Dyn4cast 11.11.00 2021-02-12

A small experimental library with only one function, i.e., _DynamicForecast_ and is perfectly working although the check result looks funny.

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
